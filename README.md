Repo for Lake Michigan Food Web Architecture project. 

The landscape theory of food web architecture (LTWFA; [Rooney et al. 2008](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01193.x)) describes relationships among animal body size, mobility, and coupling of energy channels from heterogeneous habitats. As such, it can help predict which species are likely to play a critical role in connecting different parts of a food web. However, empirical tests of the LTWFA are rare and support differs among terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. Further. the LTWFA has not yet been tested in the Great Lakes and it remains unclear whether the theory applies in highly invaded ecosystems such as Lake Michigan. In this project, we will test predictions of the LTWFA by quantifying links among animal body size, trophic position, and the coupling of energy channels from heterogeneous habitats using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratio data from organisms throughout the Lake Michigan food web.
